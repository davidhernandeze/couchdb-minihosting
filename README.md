# CouchDB Minihosting

> Forget about Couch to 5k, We can do To Couch in 5min

*CouchDB Minihosting* allows you to try out CouchDB in a matter of minutes. It provides you with a CouchDB instance, automatic TLS with Letsencrypt and even allows you to deploy a web project if you‚Äôd like to [build](https://neighbourhood.ie/blog/2025/02/05/couchdb-is-great-for-prototypes-and-side-projects) an [Offline First](https://neighbourhood.ie/blog/2024/12/05/realtime-multiuser-kanban-board-with-couchdb) [app](https://neighbourhood.ie/blog/2019/05/10/an-offline-first-todo-list-with-svelte-pouchdb-and-couchdb) with [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com).

This works very well with a Ubuntu 24.10 x64 VM on a hosting provider of your choice, for example:

- https://www.netcup.com
- https://alfahosting.de
- https://digitalocean.com
- https://www.hetzner.com
- https://www.ovhcloud.com/de/
- https://www.vultr.com

CouchDB Minihosting is a great starting point for hosting smaller CouchDB projects, prototypes and internal tooling. Depending on how much you‚Äôre willing to pay for hardware, you can get quite far with this setup, and happily accommodate a couple of thousand users (your mileage may vary, depending on what you‚Äôre doing). At some point, however, the fact that you're running a database inside of Docker will be a limitation you‚Äôll probably want to avoid, and [we can help you with that](#commercial-and-production-deployments). But that‚Äôs for future you to deal with! For now, present you can enjoy quick and simple CouchDB hosting.

## What you‚Äôll get

- A CouchDB instance with an admin user
- A [haproxy](https://www.haproxy.org) and an [nginx](https://nginx.org) setup that:
  - redirect all requests to `/_api` to that CouchDB
  - handle letsencrypt/certbot for continuous TLS certificates
  - optionally host your web project at `/`
- A deploy script that will let you deploy or roll back your web project

We are using Docker Compose to set all this up for you.

## Prerequisites

1. A Linux server or virtual machine (VM), and `ssh`  with root access to it.
2. A domain name set up to point to that server.
  - If you don‚Äôt want to pay for a top level domain (TLD), here‚Äôs a list of free services that let you register a subdomain:
    - https://freedns.afraid.org
    
3. The ability to git clone this repo onto the server, or get it there some other way.

# Setup

On your server:

Clone this repository and enter the folder:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/neighbourhoodie/couchdb-minihosting.git
cd couchdb-minihosting
```

Update the environment variables in `.env`.

- `COUCHDB_USER` and `COUCHDB_PASS`: The credentials you‚Äôd like your CouchDB admin user to have
- `DOMAIN`: The domain pointing to your server, without the protocol (eg. `backend.lol`).
- `CERTBOT_EMAIL`: An email address for certificate expiration notifications. You don‚Äôt need to set this up anywhere in advance.

```sh
nano .env
```
(To save and exit Nano: `ctrl+o`, enter, `ctrl+x`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note: The [install script](/install.sh) assumes you are not using this server for anything else. If you do, please give it a quick look to see if there is anything in there that would conflict with what you already have set up. If you run this on a VM with other things, we assume you are an expert user and generally know what you are doing.

Now run the installation  script
```sh
./install.sh
```

Done. You should now be able to access Fauxton, CouchDB‚Äôs admin panel, at `$DOMAIN/_api/_utils/` and log in with `COUCHDB_USER` and `COUCHDB_PASS`. The URL will also be logged to the terminal for convenience. üéä

# Deploying a Web Project

This repo also contains a deploy script. This is meant to be copied into the repo of the web project you want to run alongside CouchDB, and should be run from that repo. It uses a `deploy` user on the server which was already added by the installation script above.

For more details on the deploy and rollback scripts, please check out the `[/deployment/README.md](/deployment/README.md)`.

# Tips and Tricks

Some useful Docker commands

```sh
# See which Docker containers are running
$ docker ps
# Inspect the logs of a specific containers. You get the `container id` from `docker ps`
$ docker logs CONTAINER_ID_HERE
# For any of the `docker-compose` commands to work, you must be in /couchdb-mini-hosting
# Shut everything down 
$ docker-compose down
# Start everything up again
$ docker-compose up -d
# See logs from all containers together
$ docker-compose logs
```

# Roadmap ‚Äî Please Help!

- [ ] Add way to run this on local dev machines and proper TLS certs but without Letsencrypt
- [ ] Add nice error pages
- [ ] Add metrics collector and populate a default dashboard with CouchDB metrics
- [ ] Document how to add a backend container
- [ ] Add tests / CI


### Commercial and Production Deployments

As noted above, this setup is great for getting started, but might not suitable for larger and more critical deployments. The good news is that you can seamlessly migrate to a redundant CouchDB cluster setup. If you‚Äôre faced with such a task and are unsure about factors like sharding, scaling, high availability etc., [we, Neighbourhoodie Software, are available for consulting and hands-on assistance](https://neighbourhood.ie/).

If you‚Äôve already got a functioning CouchDB setup and would like it checked, we offer a [CouchDB Architecture Review](https://neighbourhood.ie/products-and-services/couchdb-architecture-review), where we inspect your setup and prepare a report with actionable suggestions for improvement, if necessary. Ongoing support retainers are also available!

You can also get your setup checked automatically with our [Opservatory service](https://opservatory.app/) and get a [SQL Query add-on](https://neighbourhood.ie/products-and-services/structured-query-server) to boot.

Please [get in touch with our lovely sales team](https://neighbourhood.ie/call) if you have any questions about commercial services. üë©‚Äçüíº üë®‚Äçüíº
